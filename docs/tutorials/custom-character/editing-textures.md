## Editing Textures
Once the character is open in BactaTank Classic, it should looks something like this (what you see will vary depending on the model used).

On the left side of the window, there are multiple dropdown buttons labeled `Textures`, `Materials`, etc. Click `Textures`. It should look something like this (amount of textures vary from character to character).

Click on one of the textures and find the one you want to edit. Clicking on a texture shows a preview on the right-hand side.

Export the texture using `CTRL+E` or by clicking ![Triple Dot Button](https://i.imgur.com/xhwAmwR.png) in the upper-right hand corner and clicking `Export Texture`. Save the texture in any place you'll remember later. Refer to [Editing Textures](../../editing/textures.md) for opening and exporting textures.

### Exporting UVs
By clicking the tab at the top that says "UV Viewer," you can view how your character's texture(s) is projected across a surface. You can save the current UV map as an image for reference by clicking the button that looks like a floppy disk and saving the file where you can remember. The button should say `Export UV Layout`.

Once the texture file is saved, you can reimport it using `CTRL+R` or by clicking ![Triple Dot Button](https://i.imgur.com/xhwAmwR.png) in the upper-right hand corner and clicking `Replace Texture`. Then select the new texture file. You should see the new texture in place of the old one.

Save the model using `CTRL+S` or clicking `File >> Save Model`. You should save it over the model in your character's folder. If you make drastic changes, be sure to keep a backup incase anything goes wrong.
