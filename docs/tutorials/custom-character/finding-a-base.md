## Finding a Base

Once the character's folder is setup, you'll need to find a character to copy as a starting point, or a base. Questions to consider when finding a base for a character are:
- Are there enough texture/mesh slots?
- Do they work with the animations I want?
- Do they have a face similar to that of the character I want?
- Do they have similar abilities to the character I want? (doesn't matter, makes txt setup easier though)

> [!NOTE]
> You may not always be able to find a good base easily, and that's okay. Some of the questions to consider can be a bit confusing for beginners. You can always ask the [TtGames Modding Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ttgames-lego-modding-539431629718945793).

Once you find a good character as a base, copy their `*_PC.GHG` and `*.TXT` files over (optionally copy `*_LR_PC.GHG` if you want to make a lo-res model). You can find character's files in their character folder. In this tutorial, I will be using "Riddler Goon" from LEGO Batman: The Videogame as a base, to make a new goon variant, Generic Goon (How creative).

Next, paste their files in your character's folder and rename them to your character's name.

> [!NOTE]
> When renaming the `*_PC.GHG` or `*_LR_PC.GHG` file, keep the `_PC` or `_LR_PC` accordingly.

Once renamed, open the character's `*_PC.GHG` file in BactaTank Classic by using `CTRL+O` in BactaTank Classic, dragging and dropping onto the window, or using `Open With...` when right-clicking the file. Continue to the next section.
