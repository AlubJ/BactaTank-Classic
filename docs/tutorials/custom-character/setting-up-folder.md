## Setting Up The Character Folder

> [!NOTE]
> This step can be skipped if you want your character to be in another character's folder (mainly used for characters sharing animations).

To start creating a character, you need to create your character's folder. The character's folder holds most of the character's files and data. To start, locate the `CHARS` folder in your game's root directory (the directory that shows up when clicking the game folder).

Then create a folder, naming it whatever you'd like (Preferrably the character's name in all caps, but you can also just make it something you can remember). This is where all the character's files will be.
