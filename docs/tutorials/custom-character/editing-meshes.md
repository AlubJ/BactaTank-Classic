## Editing Meshes
On the left side of the window, there are multiple dropdown buttons labeled `Textures`, `Materials`, etc. Click `Meshes`. It should look something like this (amount of meshes vary from character to character).

Click on one of the meshes and find the one you want to edit. Clicking on a mesh shows a preview on the right hand side.

Export the mesh using `CTRL+E` or by clicking ![Triple Dot Button](https://i.imgur.com/xhwAmwR.png) in the upper-right hand corner and clicking `Export Mesh`. Save the mesh in any place you'll remember later. 
Refer to [Editing Textures](../editing/meshes.md) for opening and exporting meshes.

Once the mesh file is saved, you can reimport it using `CTRL+R` or by clicking ![Triple Dot Button](https://i.imgur.com/xhwAmwR.png) in the upper-right hand corner and clicking `Replace Mesh`. Then select the new mesh file. You should see the new mesh in place of the old one.

Save the model using `CTRL+S` or clicking `File >> Save Model`. You should save it over the model in your character's folder. If you make drastic changes, be sure to keep a backup incase anything goes wrong.
