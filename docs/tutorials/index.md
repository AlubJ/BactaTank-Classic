# Creating a Custom Character
After [installing BactaTank Classic](../index.md#installation), the obvious next step is to create a character.

> [!NOTE]
> Character editing and creation varies in difficulty, depending on your goal. This tutorial will cover the most basic of character creation, more complex characters may require looking into some of the other docs, unless already given a tutorial.

## Editing Meshes
On the left side of the window, there are multiple dropdown buttons labeled `Textures`, `Materials`, etc. Click `Meshes`. It should look something like this (amount of meshes vary from character to character).

Click on one of the meshes and find the one you want to edit. Clicking on a mesh shows a preview on the right hand side.

Export the mesh using `CTRL+E` or by clicking ![Triple Dot Button](https://i.imgur.com/xhwAmwR.png) in the upper-right hand corner and clicking `Export Mesh`. Save the mesh in any place you'll remember later. 
Refer to [Editing Textures](../editing/meshes.md) for opening and exporting meshes.

Once the mesh file is saved, you can reimport it using `CTRL+R` or by clicking ![Triple Dot Button](https://i.imgur.com/xhwAmwR.png) in the upper-right hand corner and clicking `Replace Mesh`. Then select the new mesh file. You should see the new mesh in place of the old one.

Save the model using `CTRL+S` or clicking `File >> Save Model`. You should save it over the model in your character's folder. If you make drastic changes, be sure to keep a backup incase anything goes wrong.

## Editing the Text File
Now it's time to edit the character's text file. The text file contains specific traits of the character, like what abilities it has, animations it uses, character display name, icon, weapons, and more.
