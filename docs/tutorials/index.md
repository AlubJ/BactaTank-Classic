# Creating a Custom Character
After [installing BactaTank Classic](../index.md#installation), the obvious next step is to create a character.

> [!NOTE]
> Character editing and creation varies in difficulty, depending on your goal. This tutorial will cover the most basic of character creation, more complex characters may require looking into some of the other docs, unless already given a tutorial.

## Editing the Text File
Now it's time to edit the character's text file. The text file contains specific traits of the character, like what abilities it has, animations it uses, character display name, icon, weapons, and more.
