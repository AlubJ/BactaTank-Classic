# Model Editing
Model editing is the staple of BactaTank Classic and is what it does best, you can edit a lot of attributes inside of the model file and we will detail exactly what you can do.

## Editable Attributes Quick Overview
- [**Textures**](textures.md) - Images that get displayed onto meshes.
- [**Materials**](materials.md) - How the mesh should look in-game, setting textures and much more.
- [**Meshes**](meshes.md) - The 3D objects.
- [**Locators**](locators.md) - Positions relating to bones for extra in-game placements.

> [!NOTE]
> Hard limits exist within the file format causing adding or removing attributes not possible. You can find out more [here](../things-to-be-aware-of.md#format-limits).

## Viewable Attributes
- **Bones** - Bones (also sometimes referred to as an armature, skeleton or rig) are what the meshes bind to for animations.
- **Layers** - In-game system for rendering and LoD.

> [!NOTE]
> Hard limits exist within the file format causing editing these attributes complex, and are not editable just yet.
