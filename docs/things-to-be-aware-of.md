# Things to be Aware of
Modding games in general is a bit of a task all things considered, and a lot of games have limitations that have not been broken by their respective modding community, TtGames' LEGO Games included.

## Mod Publication
Generally, sharing your mods is considered to be okay, and it is unlikely that any copyright holder will send out a DMCA claim. Feel free to share your mods. You can publish your mods either by zipping up the modded files only (this is important) and instructions on how to install the mod, or use a mod manager like [Reloaded-ii](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II).

Never put your mod behind a paywall. This is a legally dubious tactic in trying to earn money from your mods but could potentially put yourself at legal risk. Just, like share your mods for free man.
